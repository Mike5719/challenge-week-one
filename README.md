# Week One Refactor Challenge

## In this assignment we were asked to review the provided source code for a Marketing Agency and to ensure it adheres to accessibility standards. This would ensure the site is optimized for search engines.

For this project the source code was provided and we were asked to review it ensuring the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independant of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
